## Note from the author:
> The Christian shoemaker does his duty not by putting little crosses on the shoes, but by making good shoes, because God is interested in good craftsmanship. - Martin Luther 

This project (along with iOS & Android apps) never saw production. I guess you could call it a 'poor product/market fit'. But it is well built, and crafted with stubborn-love. I pray the Lord uses this project in your life, as He used it in mine - 1 Corinthians 15:58.
