This is what we’re about: making social connections, growing spiritually, and giving of ourselves in service to others.",
    teens:      "Join us each week for our Sunday Youth Services! It's the place to be. To feel at home, relax, enjoy, receive, serve, be served, engage, have fun, bring friends, make friends, play games, learn about Jesus, worship God through music, and join a family of teens at Cornerstone! We would LOVE to see you there.",
    kids:       "Each weekend your child, newborn through sixth grade, can be a part of an exciting and active environment filled with songs, games, and activities that teach Godly values at an age-appropriate level. Our weekend children’s services meet at the same time as adult Sunday services, so while you are experiencing the creative, engaging worship and fellowship of Cornerstone, your children are experiencing it as well.",
    outreach:   "We believe that as Christ followers we display Christ's love through caring for the least of these. (Matthew 25:40)"
